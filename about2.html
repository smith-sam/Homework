    <h3>About the</h3>
    <h2 class="script">artist in the studio</h2>
    <p>I'm Samantha (Sam) Smith, based in Minnesota, and I need to create daily.
       I love walks in gardens, parks, and forests, and a nice cup of coffee on a sunny morning.
       I practice UX/UI design, Graphic Design, Drawing, Photography, Painting, Printmaking, and Sculpture. </p>

    <p>The best part of any design or art project is seeing the process of nothing becoming something,
       and even better is being part of the creation of a design. I love the challenge of taking a bunch
       of pieces and rules for a design and bringing them together to create something visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>

    <p>I have a background in Fine Arts with multiple gallery showings in St. Cloud and one in Alnwick, Northumberland
       (United Kingdom). I also have four years of in-house graphic design experience and three years of experience as
       a production artist. I have the drive to work in the creative field and love a challenge. Design and art are the most
       challenging and rewarding felids I can imagine.</p>

  <p>UX Design Case Study</p>
  <h5 class="script">travel application design</h5>
  <p>This student project was a case study in travel apps, and while looking into how people prepare for travel, we discovered people found packing for travel anxiety-provoking. I wanted to create an app to help alleviate some packing stress. At the same time, the app would assist users in staying organized during the process.

  <p>UI Design Case Study</p>
  <h5 class="script">responsive website redesign</h5>
  <p>This student project was to redesign a nonprofit organization's website,
    my group and I chose Lionsgate Academy. We found areas we thought we
    could improve the existing website. We found the site wasn't responsive,
     and not easy to navigate.  Through user testing, interviews, and finally
     redesign, we created a new site that users found more appealing and easier to navigate.</p>
